The PennyLane-Orquestra plugin integrates the Orquestra workflow management
system for quantum computing with PennyLane's quantum machine learning
capabilities.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a cross-platform Python
library for `differentiable programming
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_programming>`_ of quantum
computers.

`Orquestra <https://www.orquestra.io/>`_ is a workflow management system for quantum computing.

Features
========

* Provides four devices to be used with PennyLane: ``orquestra.forest``,
  ``orquestra.ibmq``, ``orquestra.qiskit`` and ``orquestra.qulacs``.
  These devices provide access to the various backends and simulators,
  including hardware devices like the IBM hardware, which is accessible
  through the cloud.

* Allows computing expectation values by submitting and processing Orquestra
  workflows.

* Supports a wide range of PennyLane operations.

* Combines Orquestra's execution capabilities to submit batches of circuits
  that can be executed in parallel.

Installation
============

Folder structure of the plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source folder of the plugin contains sub-folders for both server and
client-side code:

1. *Server-side*: the ``steps`` subfolder contains the functions used in
   generated workflows as steps and the ``src`` subfolder contains further
   server-side auxiliary code (if any). Orquestra imports the ``main`` branch
   of the ``pennylane-orquestra`` repository on each workflow submission, so
   server-side changes merged into the ``main`` branch take effect immediately.

2. *Client-side*: the ``pennylane_orquestra`` subfolder contains client-side
   code making up the PennyLane-Orquestra plugin.

Installation and tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin requires Python version 3.6 and above. PennyLane and the `Quantum Engine CLI <https://github.com/zapatacomputing/qe-cli>`_ are also required.
Installation of this plugin, as well as all dependencies, can be done using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pennylane-orquestra

To test that the PennyLane-Orquestra plugin is working correctly you can run

.. code-block:: bash

    make test

in the source folder. Tests that involve submitting Orquestra workflows to test
the end-to-end integration of the plugin can be run with ``make test-e2e``.

.. note::

    Tests on the `IBMQ device
    <https://pennylane-orquestra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devices/ibmq.html>`_
    can only be run if an IBM Q authentication token is available via the ``IBMQX_TOKEN``
    environment variable for the `IBM Q experience
    <https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/>`_.

    If this is the case, running ``make test-e2e`` also executes tests on the
    ``orquestra.ibmq`` device.  By default tests on the ``orquestra.ibmq``
    device run with ``ibmq_qasm_simulator`` backend. At the time of writing
    this means that the test are "free". Please verify that this is also the
    case for your account.

Further test cases for the ``steps`` used by the PennyLane-Orquestra plugin are
located in ``steps/tests``. To run these, Python version 3.7 and above is
required along with the dependencies contained in the
``steps/requirements_for_tests.txt``. Once these are available, running ``make
test-steps`` will run the ``steps`` test suite.
